How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  I look at the specifications of what is being requested, Ilook what the user wants to do and how they wwant the application to respond to their requests. By creating the user story narrative like as a user (blank), I would like to see (blank), so that I can (blank). This gives me a visual of finctionality.
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development programs as a way to mold and grow, the complexity should be exciting not intimdating and i should use the projects as a way to develop my skills in future roles. I think scrum events in agile and pursuing the different roles instead of limiting myself to one to better connect with projects and what they require from the team.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Its means having an adaptive state of mind, it means having a collaborative state of mind, it means that effective and meaningful communication should be a skill that is perfected the more you develop and it means having an open mind to new ideas.
